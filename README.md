- The purpose of this liri app is to do 4 functions:

  1. Search for an artist concert
  2. Search for a song
  3. Search for a movie
  4. Let the app decide if it should search for a concert, song, or movie

- Process

  1. A question will appear with a list of 4 options: Concert, Spotify, Movies, and Surprise Me
  2. Once a selection is made by using the arrow keys to go up and down and the enter key to select, the second question will appear asking for a second detail.
  3. If you put in a value that generates information, you will see the information appear.
  4. If you do not put a value that generates information, you will be notified.
  5. If you put a blank value, you will be notified.
  6. If the Surprise Me option is selected, a movie, concert, or song will be generated and the information will be displayed. The same result will appear as if the user
     had typed in that answer using the first 3 options
